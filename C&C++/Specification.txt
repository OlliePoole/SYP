Requirements Specification: City Distance Calculator 

A program is required to store the names of world places (cities) and their co-ordinates 
(latitude and longitude), and to calculate the distance between any two places. It should be 
possible to: 
• Perform the usual operations on the database such as, add, delete, and, modify a place and 
its co-ordinates; 
• Find the distance between any two places, identified by name; if necessary, replace or 
update a city and its coordinate. 
• Display the names of all places and their co-ordinates. 
• Any other feature, which may make the tool more practical or interesting, e.g. features for 
sorting the cities, dealing with cities having the same name, but located in different 
countries (e.g. Oxford in England, and Oxford in the USA etc.).
